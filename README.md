# Weekend Trip Destination Predictor

This project uses a dataset of global travel destinations to predict whether a location is ideal for a weekend trip, based on features like region, budget level, and location qualities (culture, beaches, nightlife, etc.).

### 🔧 Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and modeling
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations

### 📊 What It Does
- Preprocesses and transforms travel data
- Converts categorical features and travel tags into usable model inputs
- Trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest classifier to predict trip suitability
- Analyzes model performance
- Visualizes insights in Power BI (e.g., region-wise ideal trips, budget distribution)
